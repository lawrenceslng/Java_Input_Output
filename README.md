- JUnit
- Spring/Spring boot?

## Phases

1. Create basic Java backend to ingest CSV file and output to XML
2. Create basic frontend for submitting CSV file, downloading XML output
3. Create reverse function

## Future Functionalities

- Create randomly generated CSV file, use different sorting algorithms to sort information based on different criteria
- Visualize different sorting algorithms on front-end
